# Hi, I'm Jamie! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I am a computer science student currently. Topics that interest me are 
computer graphics, C++ programming and blockchain. Besides that, there 
is not much to say about myself :)
Currently, I am studying the book "The principles of programming" by
Bjarne  Stroustrup. Other languages like Rust, Go and C# are planned
to be learned.
